## Research Positions
- Research Partner @Radcliffe Institute (2021-2022): visualized relationships across semi-structured natural language documents under Prof. Elena Glassman. Extended into joint CS-History senior thesis, co-advised with Prof. Cemal Kafadar, (first CS + History thesis from Harvard, I think!) submitted March 2023. Thesis title: "Woven into War: Digital Humanities and Sephardi Women in the Late Ottoman Empire and its Diaspora, 1908 - 1945." Built [OverText_~history~](https://github.com/ENSCMA2/overtext-history), a tool for historians to make side-by-side sentence-level comparisons of groups of primary sources, as part of the thesis.
- Research Partner @Radcliffe Institute (2019-2020): investigated novel methods of evaluating multilingual word embeddings under Dr. Damián Blasi.
- Research Intern @Raytheon BBN (summer 2020): experimented with COVID-related biomedical named entity recognition for news articles as part of DARPA’s AIDA project.
- Research Intern @Affectiva (summer 2018): tried to use speech and facial cues to detect human frustration. Failed but built a [GIPHY scraper](https://github.com/ENSCMA2/giphy-scraper) which was cool.
## Software Engineering Internships
- Tableau (a Salesforce company, summer 2022): prototyped a centralized server resource management service in Java that improved resource (memory & CPU) monitoring efficiency from O(N^2) to O(N).
- Microsoft (summer 2021): built a command-line app to partially automate the prioritization and triaging of bugs for the team that gets your “Report” notifications when Windows crashes.
- Bloomberg (summer 2019): built a Bloomberg Terminal app that recommends photos for photo editors to incorporate into Bloomberg news articles.
## Other Research(-ish) Stuff
- Tech Officer for Congresswoman Anna Eshoo's Student Advisory Board (fall 2017-spring 2019): wrote policy proposals for bilingual education and regulating personal data acquisition (those were two different proposals, just to be extra clear). They're sitting somewhere in the Library of Congress. Learned what a categorical grant was and answered a question about it on the spot at the 2019 Modeling the Future Challenge (won 1st place).
- Research Fellow @AI4ALL (spring 2018): built a multi-label toxic text classifier for English Wikipedia comments. Realized that this model did not work for literally any other social media platform. Became conscious. Talked about it at [Stanford HCAI 2019](https://medium.com/stanfords-gdpi/the-future-of-human-centered-ai-governance-innovation-and-protection-of-human-rights-5c371f195232) (not about becoming conscious, but about the rest of it). Wrote [some stuff](https://medium.com/ai4allorg/making-the-internet-a-safer-place-with-ai-f97cf46b3f16) about it.
- Class projects in Computer Science:
  - A failed attempt at using transfer learning from Chinese character embeddings to improve Japanese word embeddings ([CS 287 - Deep Learning for NLP](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/CS287/))
  - An in-progress attempt at data augmentation for algorithmic fairness (CS 226R, Topics in Theory for society)
- Class projects in History
  - "Autism and Emotion in the Public Eye, 1943 - 2019": a historical investigation of public perceptions of emotions and emotionality associated with autism from 1943 to 2019 (Hist 12P, History of Emotions)
  - "Colonial Communication: The Telegraph and the Cheyenne People": an exploration of how the construction of the telegraph around present-day Colorado impacted the Cheyenne people from 1860 - 1871 (Hist 60O, American Indian History in 4 Acts)
