<p>Hello! My name is Karina, and I am a student! My main academic interest is in <strong>natural language processing/computational linguistics</strong>.</p>

<p>I am specifically interested in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>constructing evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets to make large language models more understandable (e.g. what linguistic information are they really capturing, what latent biases do they have, why does model x perform better than model y on task z)</li>
  <li>doing NLP for low-resource/non-Indo-European languages</li>
  <li>
<em>carefully</em> doing NLP for social science/social good (e.g. information extraction or visualization for long legal/medical/historical texts, hate speech detection; I’m partly studying history to make sure these applications aren’t too out of touch with reality)</li>
  <li>algorithmic fairness/ethics (especially for disabled people, ethnically minoritized people, &amp; people who are marginalized in multiple ways)</li>
  <li>intersections of NLP with human-computer interaction and data visualization</li>
</ul>
