Hello! My name is Karina, and I am a student! My interests include **natural language processing/computational linguistics**, **dance/choreography**, and **arts administration/technical theater**.

If you're an NLP person (or somewhere in the realm of CS), you might care that I am specifically interested in:  
- constructing evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets to make large language models more understandable (e.g. what linguistic information are they really capturing, what latent biases do they have, why does model x perform better than model y on task z)  
- doing NLP for low-resource/non-Indo-European languages  
- *carefully* doing NLP for social science/social good (e.g. information extraction or visualization for long legal/medical/historical texts, hate speech detection; I'm partly studying history to make sure these applications aren't too out of touch with reality)  
- algorithmic fairness/ethics (especially for disabled people, ethnically minoritized people, & people who are marginalized in multiple ways)  
- intersections of NLP with human-computer interaction and data visualization  

If you're a dance/performing arts person, you might care that I'm particularly interested in:  
- ballet, contemporary, modern, lyrical, character/folk, and jazz  
- directing and/or choreographing performances that reconstruct (or deconstruct (?)) fairytales/sci-fi or tell stories about *broader* things like health (mental & physical), neurodivergence, and social/cultural/gendered experiences
