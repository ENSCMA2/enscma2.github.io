Hello! My name is Karina, and I am a PhD student at the Carnegie Mellon University Language Technologies Institute, supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and co-advised by [Mona Diab](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html) and [Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com/)! Previously, I did my undergrad in Computer Science and History (jointly) with a minor in Statistics at Harvard College, where I worked with Professors [Stuart Shieber](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/), [Elena Glassman](https://glassmanlab.seas.harvard.edu/glassman.html), [Cemal Kafadar](https://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/cemal-kafadar), and [Dami√°n Blasi](https://www.damianblasi.org/). I have also spent summers working with [Carolina Brum](https://www.carolinabrum.com/) (Apple), [Antoine Bosselut](https://atcbosselut.github.io/), [Syrielle Montariol](https://smontariol.github.io/) (EPFL), and [Jordan Hashemi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GIMzJq4AAAAJ&hl=en) (BBN Technologies). My main academic interest is in **natural language processing/computational linguistics**.

I am specifically interested in:  
- *carefully* doing NLP for social science/social good (e.g. information extraction or visualization for legal/medical/historical material, hate speech/misinformation detection, public health advocacy)  
- NLP for low-resource/non-Indo-European languages
- algorithmic fairness/ethics (especially for disabled people, ethnically minoritized people, & subpopulations too small to be included in most research due to lack of statistical significance)  
- constructing evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets to make language models more understandable
- intersections of NLP with human-computer interaction and data visualization

I also [dance](/dance).
